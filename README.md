# Overview

A collection of assets that can be useful when working with the [Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/).  

The assets that u will find in this repo have been built or adjusted to work properly with the WebXR API.  
This means, for example, that the gamepads models will be in the right position and will have the proper rotation when synced with the WebXR hand transform.

Some of the assets have not been made by me.  
You will find a link to the source (if available) in the [Credits](#credits) section.

# License
