# Overview

A collection of assets that can be useful when working with the [Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/).  

The assets that u will find in this repo have been built or adjusted to work properly with the WebXR API.  
This means, for example, that the gamepads models will be in the right position and will have the proper rotation when synced with the WebXR hand transform.

For the assets that have not been made by me, you will find a link to the source (if available) in the [Credits](#credits) section.

A collection of Wonderland Engine template projects where you can use these assets can be found [here](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_ppefault).
